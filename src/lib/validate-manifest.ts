 * Strict arc/v1 manifest validation (arc#317, skill-estate-migration spec

 * `pai/v1` alias, tolerates a missing `capabilities` block for some types, and
 * accepts both author shapes so old packages keep installing. This validator is
 * the opposite posture — it REJECTS every legacy affordance so a repo can be
 * certified migration-clean before publish. It never mutates and never throws on
 * a rule violation; it collects EVERY violation (the CLI prints one line each)
 * so a publisher fixes the whole manifest in one pass rather than one error at a
 * time.
 *
 * Scope discipline (arc#317): this module is opt-in via `arc validate`. It does
 * NOT touch install/parse behavior and it does NOT remove the `pai/v1` alias

 *
 * arc's naming doctrine and the registry's type taxonomy use the same word for
 * different things, and `docs/design-factory-type.md` D1 rules that BOTH
 * survive. Do not collapse them:
 *
 *   1. REPO-NAME CLASS — `metafactory-bundle-<name>` is a *naming* convention
 *      for a repo shipping several related files. Its members declare an
 *      ordinary installable type: metafactory-bundle-discord is `type: skill`,
 *      metafactory-bundle-content-filter is `type: tool`. Nothing about the repo
 *      name implies `type: bundle`.
 *   2. MANIFEST TYPE — `type: bundle` (registry DD-111, DB migration
 *      `0012_add_bundle_type.sql`) is the reference-composition: the tarball
 *      carries only a manifest whose `references[]` name published packages.
 *
 * arc#334 previously rejected `type: bundle` here because the installer had no
 * case for it — a manifest could validate green and then throw at `arc install`.
 * arc#399 closes that gap from the other side: `bundle` (and `factory`) are in
 * the source enum AND handled by `planArtifactSymlinks` as composition types
 * that plan no per-type symlinks, so validator and installer agree again.
 * `factory` sidesteps the ambiguity entirely by not reusing the word (D1).
