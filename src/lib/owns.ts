/**
 * The `owns:` purge-scope primitive (arc#359).
 *
 * A package declares the runtime-created state its OWN runtime (not arc) writes
 * to disk — the leftovers `arc remove` cannot know about because arc never
 * installed them. `arc purge` reads this declaration to finish the job apt-style:
 *   - `owns.config` + `owns.state` → deleted (apt conffiles + /var).
 *   - `owns.userData`              → NAMED and KEPT, never deleted (apt /home).
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for THREE safety-critical concerns,
 * so the validator, `arc files`, and `arc purge` can never disagree. Each layer
 * enforces its guarantee INDEPENDENTLY, so a gap in one is caught by the next:
 *   1. `validateOwns`  — the load-time shape + safety gate. Rejects: home-sweeps
 *      (`~`, `~/`, leading `*`/`**`), absolute paths, any `..` path segment, and
 *      userData↔config/state overlap. Overlap is PATH CONTAINMENT (segment-aware,
 *      both directions), not string equality: a userData entry may not equal, be
 *      an ancestor of, OR be a descendant of any deletable config/state entry.
 *   2. `expandOwnsEntry` / `expandOwns` — glob expansion, ALWAYS rooted at the
 *      user's home so a pattern can only ever name paths under home. It ALSO
 *      independently refuses any entry with a `..` path segment before globbing
 *      (defense-in-depth — it does not rely on `validateOwns` having run first).
 *   3. `deleteOwnedPath` — the deletion primitive: refuse anything that escapes
 *      home (lexically or via a parent symlink), and NEVER follow a symlink OUT
 *      of the tree (unlink the link itself, never `rm -rf` its target's tree).

 *   - A leading `*`/`**` segment (`~/*`, `~/**`) is rejected — it sweeps the
 *     whole home tree.
 *   - No `..` segment anywhere (defense against escaping the declared tree).
 *   - A `userData` entry may not OVERLAP a `config`/`state` (deletable) entry —
 *     containment in either direction, compared segment-aware on the entries'
 *     non-glob path roots. The never-delete class must not equal, contain, or be
