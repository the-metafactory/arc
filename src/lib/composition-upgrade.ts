/**
 * `arc upgrade <factory>` — moving a composition to a new release
 * (arc#401, `docs/design-factory-type.md` D3 + D4).
 *
 * D3 says the factory advances to its NEW RELEASE and its members to THAT
 * RELEASE'S PINS — *never to floating latest*. D4 says why: a factory release
 * is a reproducible snapshot, and a member that floats reintroduces the
 * integration project the type exists to delete. So the new release's
 * `references[]` are the instruction set, and this module turns them into a
 * plan.
 *
 * ## Fail closed, and fail BEFORE anything moves
 *
 * The honesty rule `prepareComposition` keeps at install applies here with more
 * force, because an upgrade has an installed factory to lie about. A factory
 * whose `skills` row says v0.2.0 while its members sit on v0.1.0's pins is a
 * broken snapshot that every later command believes. So the whole plan —
 * including "does this tag exist, and does the manifest at it agree with the
 * pin" — is settled before the factory's own code is touched, and any doubt is
 * a REFUSAL naming what arc could not establish rather than a guess.
 *
 * ## What this slice supports, and what waits for arc#366
 *
 * Supported: a factory whose own source is a **git repo**, with members
 * recorded as `member_source: 'repo'`. Both move by resolving the pin to a
 * commit and checking it out — offline-capable, and exercised end to end by
 * `test/commands/composition-upgrade-401.test.ts`.
 *
 * Refused, by name:
 *  - a **registry** member that must move. `fetchAndVerifyRegistryPackage` does
 *    take an exact version, so the mechanism is not the obstacle; the obstacle
 *    is that live-registry operations are HELD under arc#366 and there is no
 *    published factory to exercise a verified pinned re-download + atomic swap
 *    against. Shipping that path untested on the supply-chain-verification
 *    route is a worse answer than a refusal that names the issue. (A registry
 *    member whose pin did NOT change needs no move and is not refused.)
 *  - a factory whose own source is the registry, for the same reason.
 *  - a new release that **adds or drops** a member. Membership change is a
 *    capability decision: adding a member widens the surface the operator
 *    approved in the one combined review (D2), and dropping one is a removal
 *    that must go through the refcounted cascade (D3/#349). Neither belongs to
 *    a command whose job is "move the pins", and doing either silently is
 *    exactly the unreviewed-arrival failure arc#400's F1 refusal exists to stop.
