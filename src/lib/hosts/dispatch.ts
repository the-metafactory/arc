/**
 * Map an artifact type to its install directory on a given host.
 *
 * Returns `null` for types that don't live inside a host's directory tree:
 *
 *   - `pipeline` / `action` — arc state (`~/.config/metafactory/{pipelines,actions}/`)
 *   - `rules`               — writes templates into the consumer repo
 *   - `library`             — meta type; contained artifacts route individually
 *   - `component`           — no per-type primary layout; uses provides.files only
 *
 * Phase 2 install dispatch (per #117) uses this to ask the host "where does
 * this go on you?" instead of hard-coding `host.paths.skillsDir` etc. at
 * every call site. When future adapters land (Codex, Cursor, …) they can
 * differ on directory naming without changing dispatch code.
 *
 * Returning `null` is the right "I cannot install this" signal — callers
 * should fall back to the arc-state path or the consumer repo, never invent
 * a host directory the adapter didn't promise.
 *
 * ## Not equivalent to `HostAdapter.supports()`
 *
 * The two answer different questions:
 *
 *   - `supports(type)` → "does the host *recognize* this artifact type?"
 *   - `hostPathFor(host, type)` → "does this type *install into* a host
 *     directory, and if so, where?"
 *
 * `host.supports("component")` is `true` (Claude Code recognizes components)
 * but `hostPathFor(host, "component")` is `null` (components don't install
 * into a host directory). Don't bridge them — calling
 * `hostPathFor(host, type)!` after a positive `supports()` check will hit a
 * null on component / rules / library.
