 *  1. The `homedir()` was RAW — it reads the OS passwd entry, so no in-process
 *     `$HOME` pin could redirect it. Every test-isolation technique arc uses was
 *     silently bypassed, and the scan walked the maintainer's actual home.
 *  2. The fallback INVENTED authority. `~/Developer` is not something the

 *     named `agents-md.yaml`, and 136 had their `CLAUDE.md` overwritten with a
 *     bare `# {PROJECT_NAME}` stub.
 *
 * Both are fixed here. The env bag is injectable, so a pinned env is honoured;
 * and **an unset `BLUEPRINT_DEV_ROOT` now means "do not scan", not "guess
 * `~/Developer`"**. `homedir()` is gone from this path entirely — there is no
 * home-relative default left to resolve.
 *
 * With no configured root the consumer set is `cwd` alone: the operator chose
 * that directory by running arc in it. Fan-out across a tree remains available,
 * but only to an operator who explicitly sets `BLUEPRINT_DEV_ROOT` — and even
 * then each repo must declare this package (enforced in `generateRules`).

/**
 * Upgrade a whole COMPOSITION (arc#401, `docs/design-factory-type.md` D3/D4).
 *
 * The factory moves to its new release; every member moves to THAT release's
 * pins — never floating latest. `lib/composition-upgrade.ts` owns the rules
 * (and the header there explains what this slice supports and what waits for
 * arc#366); this function owns the sequencing, and the sequencing is the safety
 * property:
 *
 *   1. Read the PROSPECTIVE manifest off the remote, nothing moved.
 *   2. Validate its composition declarations (exact pins, D4) — the same
 *      function `arc validate` and `arc install` run, so the three gates cannot
 *      disagree about one manifest.
 *   3. Plan the member moves; refuse a membership change or a registry member.
 *   4. PRE-FLIGHT every move: is the pin reachable, and does the manifest at it
 *      declare that version? A refusal here is a refusal with the factory still
 *      on its old release — which is the whole reason this step exists rather
 *      than being discovered halfway through step 6.
 *   5. Move the factory itself, through the ORDINARY single-package upgrade
 *      (`_skipComposition`), so its hooks, templates, node deps, rollback and
 *      `depends_on.packages` cascade are the same ones every package gets.
 *   6. Move each member through the ORDINARY `arc install --pin` path, so each
 *      inherits arc#396's dirty-tree / diverged-branch / capability-widening
 *      guards and `replaceCapabilities` — the recorded surface describes the
 *      code now checked out. `yes: true` matches `createMemberInstaller`'s
 *      posture: `arc upgrade` is non-interactive by design, and re-prompting
 *      per member is the death-by-a-thousand-confirmations D2 rejects.
 *   7. Re-record the composition at its new version and RE-TAKE the inventory
 *      snapshot, because D6's untangle proof must describe the release that is
 *      actually installed.
 *
 * Steps 5 and 6 are best-effort in opposite directions on purpose. If 5 fails,
 * nothing has moved and the refusal is clean. If a member in 6 fails, the
 * factory has already advanced; the failure is REPORTED per member (mirroring
 * arc#346's cascade contract) and the composition record is rewritten to the
 * new release for the members that DID move, so `arc list` shows the true
 * mixed state rather than a tidy fiction.
