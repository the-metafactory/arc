 *
 * Every `git checkout` call passes a trailing `--` (post-#387 review

 * pathspec. Without it, `git checkout <arg>` silently accepts an `<arg>`
 * that isn't a ref at all but IS a path in the working tree — it
 * reinterprets it as a pathspec restore ("Updated 0 paths from the

 * candidate, `--pin arc-manifest.yaml` (a file every arc package ships at
 * its repo root) — or `docs`, `src`, `test` — would silently "succeed"
 * while installing whatever the default branch happened to be, printing a
 * specific, plausible-looking pinned commit that was never actually
 * checked out. `git checkout <ref> --` fails loudly (`fatal: invalid
 * reference`, exit 128) instead. This was checked against a pre-check
 * alternative (`git rev-parse --verify "<ref>^{commit}"` before checkout)
 * and rejected: `rev-parse` does NOT perform checkout's own
 * remote-tracking-branch DWIM (a bare branch name that exists only as
 * `origin/<branch>` post-clone — i.e. every branch except whichever one
 * HEAD happened to point at when cloned — fails to resolve under
 * `rev-parse`), so that approach silently broke branch pinning. `--` keeps
 * `git checkout` itself as the resolver, so its DWIM is untouched, and

 * read its manifest, and pin the member install to the resolved COMMIT.
 *
 * ## Why the pin is a SHA, not the tag (arc#400 review, F2)
 *
 * A tag is a mutable label. Consent is read here, from a scratch clone; the
 * member then lands from a SECOND, independent clone. Handing that second clone
 * the tag NAME reopens the window between them: `git tag -f v1.0.0` in between
 * and the operator approves one commit while a different one installs. The
 * version-equality check does not close it — that compares a number in a
 * manifest, and the attacker controls the manifest too.
 *
 * So the candidate tag is used only to FIND the commit; what travels onward is
 * `git rev-parse HEAD`, and consent is bound to the bytes rather than to the
 * label that happened to point at them. `install()` resolves and checks out
 * commit SHAs robustly (arc#396/#403), so this costs nothing but the extra
 * `rev-parse`. `installCompositionMembers` then verifies the landed surface
 * against the reviewed one as a second, route-independent check.
 *
 * Exported for the moved-tag regression test, which runs this real resolver and
 * moves the tag between resolution and landing.

 * Move an ALREADY-INSTALLED package's checkout to a `--pin` ref (arc#396).
 *
 * Before this, `arc install <repo> --pin <sha>` on an installed package hit
 * the duplicate guard and returned `{success: true, alreadyInstalled: true}`
 * before any git ran — exit 0, success text, checkout untouched. A pinned
 * install is a determinism claim, so that combination is the worst possible
 * answer: automation trusts it. The README's "Pinned installs" section already
 * promised this behaviour ("Re-run `arc install --pin <ref>` to return to a
 * specific ref"), so honour the promise rather than retract it.
 *
 * Order of business, and why:
 *  1. `git fetch --force --tags` — the pin may name a ref minted since the
 *     clone, and a tag may have MOVED. Without `--force`, git refuses to
 *     update an existing local tag, so a re-tagged `v1.0.0` would resolve to
 *     the stale commit and report success: arc#396 again, one layer down. A
 *     fetch failure is NOT fatal (an offline re-pin to an already-local ref
 *     must still work); it is remembered and appended to the error if
 *     resolution then fails, so an offline miss never masquerades as "no such
 *     ref".
 *  2. Resolve the pin to a commit, remote-tracking ref first (see
 *     `resolvePinCommit`), and compare with HEAD. Equal — and, for a branch
 *     pin, already ON that branch — → nothing to do; a dirty tree is not even
 *     consulted, because nothing is going to move.
 *  3. Refuse a dirty tree. `git checkout` would either carry the operator's
 *     edits across the move or fail halfway; arc names the path and stops.
 *  4. Refuse a local branch that has DIVERGED from its origin tip. Landing on
 *     the fetched tip means fast-forwarding the local branch, and a diverged
 *     branch carries local commits that a `reset --hard` would delete.
 *  5. Read + validate the manifest at the target commit and run the
 *     capability-widening consent gate — all BEFORE anything moves.
 *  6. Reuse `checkoutPinnedRef` — the same function the fresh-clone path uses,
 *     so the `--` pathspec guard, the candidate order, and the
 *     install-time-pin warning are identical by construction, not by
 *     duplication. Fast-forward the branch onto the fetched tip afterwards
 *     when the pin named one.
 *  7. Install the new ref's node dependencies, then record the new version and
 *     capability surface. A dependency failure rolls the checkout back rather
 *     than recording a move whose code cannot run.
